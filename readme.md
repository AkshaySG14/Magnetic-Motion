\f0\fs24 \cf0 	This demo is operated exclusively through the mouse. A left click will shoot the ball from the launcher. A right click will spawn a negative electric charge. This electric charge will deflect the ball. An additional right click will change the negative charge into a positive one, which will attract the ball. Clicking the charge once more will delete it.\
	The middle mouse button will spawn a bumper, which can interact with the charges the same way the ball does. It will also rebound with balls, simulating the act of transfer of momentum. The two facets of magnetic attraction and momentum should serve as a fun physics demo. \
